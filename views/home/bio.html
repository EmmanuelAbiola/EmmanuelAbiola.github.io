   I am Emmanuel Abiola, a final year Engineering student from the University of Nottingham. I have a passion for constructing Mobile Applications; this has seen me lead the development of over ten profitable applications whilst at university, working alongside a fellow group of programmers. This has really helped to boost my software engineering skills - in particular, Android development, whilst retaining a great deal of interest in iOS and Web development.
